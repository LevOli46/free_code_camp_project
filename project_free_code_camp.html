<h2>Here's a time line of Dr.Praeger's life</h2>

<p>Dr. Praeger’s Sensible Foods® was founded in 1994 with the mission to bring delicious frozen food to everyone.</p>
<p>It’s not every day that two heart surgeons get into the food business, but over 20 years ago that’s exactly what our dads did. Motivated by what they saw in their practice, our parents set out on a mission to encourage sensible eating. They knew ingredients had to be nutritious and simple, that everything had to be delicious, and that their products needed to be super simple to make. While the world has changed since our little family business first got started, our focus remains true to our dads’ vision and we work every day to make them proud. Here’s our story…

<h3>How Saving a Life Ended Up Saving a Business</h3>

<p>Our history dates back to 1994 when our dads, medical partners and cardiothoracic surgeons, conducted emergency surgery to save a man’s life. They wound up also saving a business. After a successful operation, the group became friends. Later, the patient introduced our dads to the owner of Ungar’s Heimeshe Gefilte Fish Company. The heart specialists were hooked.</p>
<p>After acquiring the company (while keeping their busy medical practice) the pair launched Dr. Praeger’s Sensible Foods® to provide nutritious, delicious, and convenient frozen foods. The idea was to  offer food that tasted so good it’d be much easier to help people to adopt better eating habits.</p>
